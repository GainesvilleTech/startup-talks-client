      "question": "Who are your primary influencers?",
      "answer": "I know this is a pretty stock answer, but my primary influencers must be
      my parents. Their life journeys have taken them from small-town India to
      the U.S., where they’ve really epitomized the American Dream. I never
      really gave them credit for the courage and persistence they embodied as
      they embarked on their adventure, raised a family, and became successful
      doctors. I've been fortunate to witness their growth as individuals, and
      I'm incredibly proud of them."

      "question": "How do you balance growing and strengthening your current business while
      looking for opportunities to innovate?",
      "answer": "I couldn’t agree more with that sentiment, but it’s so incredibly
      hard to find that balance. In my opinion, a lot of business leaders take their
      eyes off the ball and are always constantly chasing the latest and greatest
      new shiny object without really focusing enough on cultivating the business
      they have. I’ve seen far more businesses fail by stretching themselves too
      thin and trying to grow bigger and better in a hurry than I have businesses
      who fail because they focused too much on their current business.
      <br /><br />
      I find that those businesses who are disciplined and have incredible focus
      are ultimately those that “win”, so I would lean towards really ensuring that
      you’ve cultivated your current business to it’s greatest extent before moving
      on to the next big innovation. "

      "question": "What would you say has been the defining moment for you as a
      business leader to this point in your career?",
      "answer": "I don’t know if I have a singular defining moment. I believe that
       the notion of there being a singular “aha moment” or something similar is a
       false one. One of the moments that I am most proud of was when we became
       profitable. It had been a long, winding, harrowing road to get there -
       and it’s not something a lot of startups ever accomplish. It certainly
       wasn’t the end of the road, but it validated our business model."

      "question": "What drives you to take on the challenges of running a business?",
      "answer": "The biggest thing that drives me to take on the challenge of
      running the business is the sheer amount of experience and knowledge I gain
      from this process. I don’t know if I’ll ever learn as much as I have been
      able to running my own business. It’s like a PhD, an MBA,  and a bunch of
      other degrees all rolled up into one incredible experience. "

      "question": "What book is on your kindle or playing on audible right now?",
      "answer": "I’m listening to “American Gods” by Neil Gaiman. I’ve always been
      fascinated by ancient cultures, their belief systems, and specifically their
      mythologies. American Gods is a really innovative take on the clash between
      traditional beliefs and religion vs. modern society and culture. "

      "answer": "I focus on building the best team I can.  If the team is always strong and bought into my vision, we will be able to face any adversity that may come our way.  The company is only as strong as the team and culture that is in place.  With the right people in place, because they are ‘running the show,’ I can focus my attention to new innovative revenue driving opportunities. "

      "question": "What would you say has been the defining moment for you as a
      business leader to this point in your career?",
      "answer": "When I split with my partner in January of 2006. The thoughts going through my head at the time —>  “Should I give myself a pat on the back and say ‘great effort’ and throw in the towel because this partnership failed?  Do I have what it takes to start all over and build this business up as the ‘only’ leader?  Are my friends and family going to look at me as a failure?” This was that defining moment for sure.  I started all over and have successfully built a team that has built one of the most influential scooter dealerships in the country. "
