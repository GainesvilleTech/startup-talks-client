        Abhi Lokesh is the co-founder and CEO of Fracture. Born in Saudi Arabia,
        Abhi was raised internationally, living in India, London, and New York
        before settling in the Tampa Bay Area with his family. Abhi Lokesh graduated
        from UF in 2009 with a bachelors degree in integrative biology. During
        undergrad, he was actively involved with the Center for Entrepreneurship and
        Innovation, eventually becoming the president of the student ambassadors in
        his senior year. He also conducted materials science research, which helped
        contribute to the NASA Mars Rover program. His entrepreneurial experience
        came from working for three years at Optima Neuroscience, a local med-tech
        startup, where he was able to immerse himself in the numerous facets of a
        young, fast-paced company.

        In 2006, he collaborated with two classmates, including future business
        partner Alex Theodore, to start a nonprofit focused on alleviating the health
        and poverty epidemic in Swaziland, Africa. His role focused on revenue
        generation and business development. This became the foundation from which
        Fracture, their current venture, was born. Since graduating and co-founding
        Fracture, they have sold over 400,000 Fractures to more than 100,000 customers
        in 80 countries.
