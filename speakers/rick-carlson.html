    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <p>
      Rick is a founder and CEO of SharpSpring. He started with the goal of bringing
      marketing analytics and automation tools to small and medium businesses on an
      affordable and easy-to-use SaaS platform. Rick has over 15 years of executive
      management experience in the technology sector, holding president, CEO, general
      manager, and board positions at several successful Internet security companies.
      When Rick is not working on SharpSpring, he is busy with his second, and far
      more complex start-up â€“ his two sons. Sometimes, Rick still gets to play beach
      volleyball, and occasionally, his wife politely laughs at his jokes.
