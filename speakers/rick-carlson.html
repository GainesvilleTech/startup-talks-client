        Rick is a founder and CEO of SharpSpring. He started with the goal of bringing
        marketing analytics and automation tools to small and medium businesses on an
        affordable and easy-to-use SaaS platform. Rick has over 15 years of executive
        management experience in the technology sector, holding president, CEO, general
        manager, and board positions at several successful Internet security companies.
        When Rick is not working on SharpSpring, he is busy with his second, and far
        more complex start-up â€“ his two sons. Sometimes, Rick still gets to play beach
        volleyball, and occasionally, his wife politely laughs at his jokes.
