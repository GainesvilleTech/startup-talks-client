      <p>
        President and Founder of 352 Inc., Geoff Wilson is a tech entrepreneur, investor and mentor who 
        found his passion for business at an early age. After starting a successful computer store in high 
        school, Geoff began building websites in his college fraternity house room and 352 Inc. was born. 
        20 years later, his digital product development agency has grown to 70 employees with offices in 
        Atlanta, Tampa and Gainesville, FL.
      </p>
      <p>
        As 352 grew, Geoff began to focus on the powerful impact of lean and agile methodologies. Geoff 
        implemented these principles into 352 by reorganizing the agency into cross-functional teams and 
        turning managers into servant leaders. Free to focus on a single project at a time, his teams’ 
        quality of work, productivity and morale dramatically increased. Good client relationships became 
        great ones, and 352 began down a path of unprecedented growth. Geoff calls his management philosophy 
        "Barely Manage to Lead" and speaks at conferences about how this approach can improve any type of 
        business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Geoff and his wife, Kim Wilson, also have built and sold a highly successful digital product, 
        SocialNewsDesk. SocialNewsDesk is an online social media management platform for newsrooms, and is 
        currently being used by 85% of the television newsrooms in the United States to manage their social 
        presence. SocialNewsDesk was acquired in 2014 by a Fortune 500 company, Graham Holdings. Geoff has 
        also Co-Founded several other successful startups, including iLS Network and novi AMS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Geoff's success lead him to be named one of America’s Top 30 Young Entrepreneurs by INC Magazine, 
        and the University of Florida Warrington College of Business’ Young Entrepreneur of the Year.
