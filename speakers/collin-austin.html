    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <p>
      Collin is the Founder and COE (Chief of Everything) of one of the largest
      scooter dealerships in the country, New Scooters 4 Less (NS4L). A graduate
      of the University of Florida, Collin founded the company in 2004 after
      continuously being met with signs for ‘Full Bus’ while waiting for his
      transportation. Thirteen years later, Collin has been instrumental in
      enhancing the way Gainesville commutes. NS4L’s motto is: “Create and
      recreate the ultimate customer experience.” The company continues to break
      it's own records and those of other top scooter distributors in the country,
      has provided a score of jobs, reached millions of dollars in revenue while
      selling and servicing thousands of scooters. Now NS4L’s mission is to
      “Make Gainesville the scooter capital of the world”. This year, the team
      created a new product line called Gainesville Golf Carts after seeing the
      opportunity to serve a new customer demographic.

      Collin became an investor, then a majority stakeholder and eventually sold
      Gulejo Coffee to help fuel other entrepreneurs and their teams. Collin is
      an active member in the Gainesville community, through being involved in
      several mentoring opportunities, has facilitated a group of young CEO’s in
      an entrepreneur roundtable created by the Chamber, and has served on the
      Diplomat Team for the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce. Collin says:
      “I serve my most important role as a follower of Jesus Christ, a husband
      to my wife Shannon, and a father to my two sons, Schaefer and Maddox.”
