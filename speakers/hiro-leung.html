        Start with two recent University of Florida grads. Throw in a couple "temporary" jobs at a local sushi restaurant. 
        Add some uncovered talent and newfound passion. Sprinkle in an epiphany. What do you get: an imaginative new way to 
        bring the essence of Japanese restaurants that push Japanese Beyond Sushi.
      </p>

      <p>
        For Hiro Leung, his venture began with the opening of Dragonfly Gainesville in 2000. An upscale, modern interpretation 
        of a traditional Japanese pub, or izakaya, Dragonfly restaurant is one of Gainesville’s most unique and desired Japanese 
        restaurants, with two-hour dinner waits still a weekly occurrence more than 18 years after opening its doors.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2010 another epiphany hit. This time while Hiro and Song were traveling to Orlando. Just like with the original 
        Dragonfly, they looked at the market and knew they could do better. Enter Orlando's Dragonfly focusing on the traditional 
        culture of Robata Grilling. Like the original restaurant, Dragonfly Orlando focuses on the freshly selected Sushi and 
        Japanese Tavern food and beverages locally found in dark alleyways of Ginza Japan. But unlike the original restaurant, 
        Dragonfly Orlando focuses on the art of grilling on imported Japanese white Binchotan Charcoal.

      <p>
        Fast forward another 6 years. March of 2016, the duo with their executive chef Ray Hideaki Leung opened their Miami 
        location under the concept that reminded the Chef and owner Hiro of the childhood memories with their father taking 
        them to the busiest Fish Market in the world known as Tsukiji.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since their opening, Dragonfly restaurants have won numerous awards including <i>Battle Sushi during the 2017 South Beach 
        Seafood Festival, multiple appearances on Eater's top 10 heat maps and best places to dine in Miami, and Florida Trend 
        Magazine's Golden Spoon Award 2015-2017</i> just to name a few. But, his greatest rewards are the meaningful connections 
        made throughout the years with his guests, his new son (Nikko), and his life partner Lili—his biggest fan and critic.
